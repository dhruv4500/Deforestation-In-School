<h3>Loss of Habitat</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>One of the most dangerous and unsettling effects of deforestation is the loss of<br>
   animal and plant species due to their loss of habitat. 70% of land animals and<br>
   plant species live in forests. Not only does deforestation threaten species known<br>
   to us, but also those unknown.</p>
</div>
<h3>Increased Greenhouse Gases</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>In addition to the loss of habitat, the lack of trees also allows a greater amount of<br>
   greenhouse gases to be released into the atmosphere. Healthy forests absorb carbon <br>
   dioxide from the atmosphere, acting as valuable carbon sinks. Deforested areas lose<br>
   that ability and release more carbon.</p>
</div>
<h3>Water In the Atmosphere</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>The trees also help control the level of water in the atmosphere by helping to regulate<br>
   the water cycle. In deforested areas, there is less water in the air to be returned to<br>
   the soil. This then causes dryer soil and the inability to grow crops.</p>

<h2>Consequences Of Deforestation On The Ecosystem</h2>

<h3>Soil Erosion</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>It's easy to think of soil as compact and unmoving, but that isn't always accurate. Soil<br>
   can be surprisingly loose, and it doesn't always stay in the same place. It can be washed <br>
   away by rain or blown away by wind if it isn't properly anchored.The roots of plants, mostly. <br> 
   This is especially true of trees, which have roots large enough to anchor large swaths of <br>
   soil. When humans clear large forests, soil erosion can become a serious problem. In some area<br>
   eroding soil can lead to disastrous mudslides. Large amounts of soil can wash into local streams<br>
   and rivers, clogging waterways and causing damage to hydroelectric structures and irrigation <br>
   infrastructure. In certain areas, soil erosion issues caused by deforestation lead to farming<br>
   problems and loss of reliable electric power.</p>
</div>
<h3>Biodiversity Losses</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>Living things have mastered the art of adapting to new environments. This is how life on Earth<br>
   manages to thrive from the Arctic tundra to burning hot deserts. However, it takes time for life<br>
   to adapt. Deforestation alters land too quickly for plants and animals to cope, which means that<br>
   many of them do not survive. If enough deforestation occurs, entire species can be wiped out.<br>
   This loss of life is known as biodiversity loss.</p>
